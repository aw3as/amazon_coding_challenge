# Shorty

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a URL shortener web
application, using [rack](http://address).

The basic specs are in `spec`. This requires ruby 1.9.3, and all you should need
to get started is `bundle && rake`. The app spec, which serves as an integration
test, defines the http interface.
